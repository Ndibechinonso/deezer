This is DEEZIFY

A music streaming analysis app that uses Deezer's API to enable Deezer users view(last played, artists, genres, preview playlists) and manage their data(create and delete playlists) and also get recommendation(preview recommended albums).

This app was built with ReactJs, state managed and api calls made using React-Redux

The App's server is hosted on Heroku

Some features are still being sorted out with deezer like adding tracks to playlists
